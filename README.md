# Human Age, Gender, Emotion Detection using Face Detection

üë§ This project utilizes `face_recognition` and `deepface` libraries to perform real-time analysis of faces, providing predictions for age, gender, and emotion.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code (or any Python environment of your preference)

## Installation

### 1) Open Anaconda Prompt and execute the following commands to install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python
     pip install face_recognition
     pip install numpy
     pip install deepface
### 2)Additionally, download the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file and place it in the same directory as the code.

## Usage
### 1) Clone this repository to your local machine using this Code
      ```python
      git clone https://github.com/ironpiratedev/bus-tracking.git
### 2) Open the project in your preferred Python environment (Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code).
### 3) Run the code.

## How it Works
The code uses face_recognition for face detection and deepface for age, gender, and emotion prediction. The detected faces are analyzed in real-time, providing insights about the person's age, gender, and current emotion.
